The Smart Registration Logic (RegisterController.php)The system intelligently handles user data to prevent duplicates while allowing legitimate upgrades. The logic flow includes:New User: Creates a record. If "Free Trial", automatically triggers the Google Classroom API.Existing "Free" User:Retrying Free Trial? ⛔ Blocked (Prevents abuse).Upgrading to Full? ✅ Allowed (Updates existing record to "Pending" & preserves history).Existing "Full" User: ⛔ Blocked (Already enrolled).2. Google Classroom Automation (GoogleClassroomService.php)Instead of manual invites, the system uses a custom service to communicate with Google:PHP// Example: Inviting a student automatically
$google = new GoogleClassroomService();
$courseId = env('GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_FREE_ID');
$google->inviteStudent($email, $courseId);
3. Admin Approval Workflow (EnrolleesController.php)Admins review "Full Access" applications. The approval process is fully automated:Admin clicks "Approve".System updates status to approved in MySQL.System connects to Google API and sends the official Classroom invite.Admin receives a visual confirmation via SweetAlert.🛠️ Tech StackBackend: Laravel 10 (PHP)Frontend: Blade Templates, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.jsDatabase: MySQLIntegrations:Google Classroom API: For automated student invites.Gmail SMTP: For transactional emails.SweetAlert2: For beautiful, responsive user alerts.Chart.js: For data visualization.🚀 Installation & SetupPrerequisitesPHP >= 8.1ComposerMySQLNode.js & NPMStep-by-Step GuideClone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/re-mentor.git
